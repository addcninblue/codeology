# README

This is the website for the Codeology club at Berkeley

Before getting started, make sure you're running the latest MacOS, installed all the security updates, and installed all XCode developer tools.

Check out this repository to your local workspace ([GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) is recommended).

Next, [install rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation) and
[add ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build#installation) to
manage your Ruby versions and gems:

```
rbenv install 2.2.2
gem install bundler
```

You'll also need to have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and MySQL installed
([This can be tricky on Mac OS X](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11945530/549397))
because it's a dependency for the `mysql2` gem:

```
brew install mysql
```

Finally, install the gems necessary for development, testing, and deployment:

```
bundle install
```

If you have trouble installing libv8 on El Capitan, see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19577759/installing-libv8-gem-on-os-x-10-9).
